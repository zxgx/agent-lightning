Agent-lightning v0.3.0 is a major release that introduces several new features and bug fixes. The release is a collaborative effort between Agent-lightning core teams and the community. Thanks to all the contributors who made this release possible.

### Highlights

* **Tinker integration**: Support Tinker as an alternative backend for Reinforcement Learning (#226 #245 #264 #269 #327). See [example code](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/tree/v0.3.0/examples/tinker), [blog 1](https://medium.com/@yugez/tuning-any-ai-agent-with-tinker-agent-lightning-part-1-1d8c9a397f0e) and [blog 2](https://medium.com/@yugez/tuning-any-ai-agent-with-tinker-agent-lightning-part-2-332c5437f0dc).
* **Azure OpenAI integration**: Support Azure OpenAI as a backend for LLM inference and supervised fine-tuning (#256 #327). [Example code](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/tree/v0.3.0/examples/azure).
* **MongoDB-based Lightning Store** is added as an alternative backend for Lightning Store (#323). [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/tutorials/parallelize/#parallelizing-lightningstore).
* **Contrib package**: Add contrib package for community projects. Search-R1 is integrated as a contrib recipe. More coming. (#239 #396 #410 #412 #417).
* **RESTful API**: Stabilize and document RESTful API for Lightning Store (#241 #275). [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/reference/restful/).
* **OTel Semantic Conventions** that are specifically designed for Agent-optimization areas (#340). [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/reference/semconv/).
* *[Preview]* **Agent-lightning Dashboard** is now available (#288 #289 #291 #296 #371 #375). It's the official web application for inspecting and debugging Agent-lightning experiments. See details [here](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/tutorials/debug/).
* *[Preview]* **Multi-modality example** featuring VERL and a LangGraph agent on ChartQA dataset (#379). [Example code](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/tree/v0.3.0/examples/chartqa).
* *[Preview]* Integrate **Claude Code** as a LitAgent and support training on SWE-Bench (#332 #346 #348). [Example code](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/tree/v0.3.0/examples/claude_code).
* *[Preview]* **Weave tracer** as a substitute for AgentOps tracer (#277 #411 #420 #423). [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/tutorials/traces/#weave-tracer-experimental).
* *[Preview]* **Trajectory Level Aggregation** for more efficient training with VERL. See [blog](https://agent-lightning.github.io/posts/trajectory_level_aggregation/) and [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/0.3.0/algorithm-zoo/verl/).

### Store Benchmark

In this release, the Lightning Store core was redesigned for significantly greater efficiency and scalability (#315 #318 #328 #342 #344 #356 #380 #388 #418 #421). The benchmark results below demonstrate the impact: with large numbers of concurrent runners, v0.3.0 delivers up to a 15x increase in throughput compared to v0.2.2.

| Throughput (\#rollout/sec) | v0.2.2 | v0.3.0 (in-memory) | v0.3.0 (Mongo) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Minimal (batch, #runner=32, #turns=6) | 8.73 | 9.06 | 8.71 |
| Medium (batch, #runners=100, #turns=10) | 12.03 | 23.26 | 32.79 |
| Mid-high (batch, #runners=300, #turns=6) | 10.61 | 24.42 | 40.24 |
| Large (batch, #runners=1000, #turns=3) | 3.36 | 14.60 | 50.05 |
| Long queue (queue, #runners=256, #turns=4) | 7.42 | 30.86 | 57.01 |
| Heavy trace (queue, #runners=512, #turns=20) | 5.93 | 13.28 | 29.41 |

*Notes:*

1. Benchmarks were run on a single Standard_D32as_v4 Azure VM (Large and heavy trace tests used Standard_D64ads_v5), executed via GitHub Actions.
2. Two algorithm patterns are evaluated: the batch pattern submits a group of rollouts and waits for all to finish before starting the next group, while the queue pattern maintains a set number of in-flight rollouts, submitting new ones as soon as capacity frees up. Configuration details are available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/blob/v0.3.0/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml).
3. The number of turns is directly proportional to the number of spans each rollout generates.
